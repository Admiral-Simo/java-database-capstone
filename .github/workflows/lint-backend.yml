    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository's code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up JDK 17, which is required by your project
      - name: Set up JDK 17

      # Step 3: Run the Maven Checkstyle plugin
      # This command will analyze your code for style violations.
      # It requires the checkstyle plugin to be configured in your pom.xml.
      # If not configured, this will fail. For now, we assume a basic setup.
